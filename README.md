<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Task Board Demo

![Project Blog Post Demo](/Assets/taskBoardDemo.gif)


This project was about creating a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks. The focus revolves around using third party APIs to dynamically update the HTML and CSS, namely jQuery.

Here's why we're doing this:
* Sets the learning stage for jQuery, Bootstrap, and Day.js
* Deeper experience with event listeners using these libraries
* Learn about Modals and get a richer sense of how interactive and complex something this simple can be.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

GIVEN a task board to manage a project
- [x] WHEN I open the task board
      THEN the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed)
- [x] WHEN I view the task board for the project
      THEN each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red)
- [x] WHEN I click on the button to define a new task
      THEN I can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog
- [x] WHEN I click the save button for that task
      THEN the properties for that task are saved in localStorage
- [x] WHEN I drag a task to a different progress column
      THEN the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing
- [x] WHEN I click the delete button for a task
      THEN the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing
- [x] WHEN I refresh the page
      THEN the saved tasks persist
